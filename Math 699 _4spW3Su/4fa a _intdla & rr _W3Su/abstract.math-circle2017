Goldbug Variations (Madison Math Circle, 13 November 2017)

I'll discuss the motion of little mathematical bugs: they hop around
the positive integers, flipping direction arrows as they go.  How many
such bugs drop off the line at -1, and how many escape to infinity?
Next, we tackle a similar problem in the plane, and discover beautiful
geometrical patterns, known as Propp Circles.
