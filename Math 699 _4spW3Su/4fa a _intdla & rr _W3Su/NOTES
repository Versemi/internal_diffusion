1D case:

- Use rr1d to generate rows of arrows as a function of # of bugs.
- The "waiting times" are Fibonacci.  Use this to predict max extent.
- Make some arrows and bugs!  Make two "holes".
- Work out examples with arrows and bugs.
- List Fibonacci numbers.
- Write code that "animates".
- Discuss maximum extent.  How fast does it grow?
- Show never hops around forever (56, top left).  Could still go to inf though!

2D case:

- Do arrows again?  Much harder.
- Run command with increasing number of particles.
- Point out nice structures that emerge.
- Could modify the rules on the fly?
